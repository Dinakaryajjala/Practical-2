# Football Match Analysis: Goal Scored vs. Attempts

## Overview

This project explores the correlation between **Goals Scored** and **Attempts** in football matches. By analyzing the **FIFA 2018 Match Statistics** dataset, the aim is to understand how the number of attempts impacts goal scoring games. The dataset contains various match statistics, including goals scored, attempts, possession, man of the match and other

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **FIFA 2018 Match Statistics** dataset available on Kaggle.
